We have two options:\n- **Interaction Create**: Creation via interaction occurs through a textual channel that will serve as a container for the message that will enable its creation through a component (button).\n- **Automatic Create**: Creation via the automatic process occurs through a voice channel that will serve as an entry point to initiate the process. Each user who accesses it will consequently have a voice channel created.\n\n*(!) No channel must be created, Alka will handle the creation.*",

This system allows the user, through a command that requires the assignment of permission hashes (Read the documentation), to grant access to certain users in their own private voice channel.\n- **Free:** The free category does not use permission systems and allows open access to everyone. It can be useful as a lobby for rooms of various games to allow for party searching.",
