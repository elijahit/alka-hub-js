    "description_embed": "Welcome to the setup to configure the Auto Voice System. First, let's carefully choose what type of Auto Voice we want to configure. We have two options:\n- **Interaction Create**: Creation through interaction occurs via a textual channel that will serve as the container of the message allowing its creation through a component (button).\n- **Automatic Create**: Creation through the automatic process occurs via a voice channel that will serve as the entry point to initiate the process. Every user accessing it will consequently have a voice channel created.\n- **Incrementer Create**: Creation through increment occurs via a voice channel composed of an identifying number. For proper functionality, the number must always be present, and only the channel name can be changed, for example: (Voice 1). Each access to that channel creates a voice channel underneath it, for example: (Voice 2). **Inherit channel permissions based on how it's set up.**\n\n*(!) No channels should be created; Alka will handle their creation.*",
