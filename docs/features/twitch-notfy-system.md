# Twitch Notify System

The Twitch notification system has been carefully designed to offer dynamic and flexible features. With this system, you have full control over your notifications, allowing you to customize them based on your preferred Discord channels. This flexibility ensures a highly customizable and user-friendly experience. Stay informed and connected to your favorite streamers effortlessly, thanks to this intuitive and versatile system!

## Notifications? How do they work

The Alka Hub Twitch notification system works by monitoring streamer events and sending a notification to all Discord communities where the streamer has been registered. Thanks to this advanced technology, we can ensure that notifications are sent within about two minutes of the stream starting. This ensures that community members are promptly informed and can join the stream without delays.

## Twitch Notify Command

The `/twitchnotify` command is designed to allow users to manage notification settings for Twitch service within the Discord server. Users can use this command to add or remove a specific Discord channel from the list of notification destinations when a streamer goes live on Twitch. When a streamer starts a broadcast on Twitch, the notification system will automatically send an alert to the Discord channel selected through this command, keeping users updated on the live events of their favorite streamers.

## Twitch List Command

The `/twitchlist` command provides users with a detailed list of Discord channels configured to receive notifications when a streamer goes live on Twitch. It transparently displays all Discord channels that have been added to the notification destination list, allowing users to have full control over notification settings and to know exactly where alerts will be sent when a streamer starts a broadcast on Twitch.
