# Welcome Message System

Our system utilizes a range of advanced features to create a unique welcome message for every newcomer. With our technology, we can automatically generate a personalized image that includes the user's name, profile picture, and your server's name. Furthermore, we offer the ability to further customize the appearance of the welcome message, allowing you to select a background via a link with a 1280 x 720 photo and choose the message to be contained in the embed message.

To ensure clear readability of the message, you can choose between white or black text based on the selected background. This allows you to tailor the welcome message to your aesthetic preferences and ensure it is easily readable for all server members.

Our goal is to provide server administrators with a simple and intuitive tool to create a memorable welcome experience for every new member. With our welcome message system, you can focus on engaging the community and creating a welcoming environment for all your members.

## Welcome Command

The `/welcome` command allows you to configure the welcome message for new users in the Discord server. Here's how it works:

1. **Channel Configuration**: First, you'll need to specify the channel where you want to send the welcome message.
2. **Text Color**: You can choose between white and black color for the text of the generated image.
3. **Custom Background**: If desired, you can input a URL link of a 1280 x 720 image to be used as the background in the generated image for the welcome message.

Once the initial configuration is completed, a modal will appear asking you to input the text for the welcome message. This text can be customized based on your preferences or left blank if you prefer not to use any text.

After completing all configurations, the welcome message will be ready to be sent to new members of the Discord server, offering them a warm and personalized welcome.

Continue using the `/welcome` command to update or modify the welcome message at any time and ensure that the entry experience into your Discord server is as enjoyable as possible for all new members.
