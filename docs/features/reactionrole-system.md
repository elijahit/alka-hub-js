# Reaction Role System

## Introduction

Our reaction roles system has been carefully designed following detailed guidelines provided by our vibrant Discord community. We have dedicated time and effort to ensure that the system is fully compatible with every type of message present in the server. Thanks to the simple interaction via emoji, users can easily assign themselves customized roles, ranging from colors to games, from manga to TV series, and much more! The possibilities are virtually limitless and depend only on your imagination. With our reaction roles system, we have created a versatile and dynamic tool that adds a touch of personalization and fun to our users' experience on Discord.
