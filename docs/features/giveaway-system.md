## Giveaway Command

The `/giveaway` command represents the key tool for creating your custom giveaways. With this function, you'll have complete control over the creation of your giveaways, allowing you to quickly and easily enter the necessary information. You can clearly and concisely define the prize, specify the number of slots available for participation (with the option to set them to 0 to allow unlimited entries), indicate the desired number of winners, and set a deadline in a predefined format (DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM).

If the localTime is not instantiated through the `/init` command, the standard localTime, which is UTC, will be used.

This command offers total flexibility, allowing you to adapt each giveaway to your specific needs. Whether it's distributing unique prizes, engaging a wide audience, or celebrating special occasions, the `/giveaway` command will allow you to organize and manage giveaways efficiently and professionally. Whether you're Discord server administrators, community managers, or gaming enthusiasts, this command will provide you with the necessary tools to create engaging and rewarding experiences for your users. Keep exploring the potential of the `/giveaway` command and discover how to make your giveaways even more exciting and memorable for all participants.

## Giveaway Participants Command

The `/giveawayparticipants` command is designed to provide administrators with the ability to access the complete list of participants for a specific giveaway. By using the unique ID associated with the giveaway, easily accessible in the footer of the giveaway itself, this command provides a detailed snapshot of user interaction with the event. Through this function, administrators can monitor user enthusiasm and participation, evaluating the effectiveness of the giveaway and adapting engagement strategies accordingly.

## Giveaway End Command

The `/giveawayend` command allows you to prematurely conclude a giveaway compared to its scheduled end date. This function provides Discord server administrators with the flexibility to terminate a giveaway at any time, regardless of the initially established date. By using this command, you can immediately end the giveaway and announce winners, if applicable, without waiting for the scheduled end. This allows for quick and efficient management of giveaway activities, adapting to the specific needs of the community or resolving any unforeseen situations that require the early closure of the event.
