# YouTube Notify System

The YouTube notification system has been carefully designed to offer dynamic and flexible features. With this system, you have full control over your notifications, allowing you to customize them based on your preferred Discord channels. This flexibility ensures a highly customizable and user-friendly experience. Stay informed and connected to your favorite YouTubers effortlessly, thanks to this intuitive and versatile system!

## Notifications? How do they work

The Alka Hub YouTube notification system works by monitoring the events of content creators and sending a notification to all Discord communities where the creator has been registered. Thanks to this advanced technology, we can ensure that notifications are sent within about two minutes of the content being uploaded. This ensures that community members are promptly informed and can engage with the content without delays.

## YouTube Notify Command

The `/youtubenotify` command is designed to allow users to manage notification settings for YouTube service within the Discord server. Users can use this command to add or remove a specific Discord channel from the list of notification destinations when a content creator uploads a new video on YouTube. When a creator uploads a video on YouTube, the notification system will automatically send an alert to the Discord channel selected through this command, keeping users updated on the latest uploads of their favorite creators.

The `/youtubelist` command provides users with a detailed list of Discord channels configured to receive notifications when a content creator uploads a new video on YouTube. It transparently displays all Discord channels that have been added to the notification destination list, allowing users to have full control over notification settings and to know exactly where alerts will be sent when a creator uploads a new video on YouTube.
